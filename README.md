# Digital Shelves
Many students depend on their campus libraries to loan them important items such as laptops, headphones, calculators, etc. However, there is not an easy way to find out what resources are available. Though students could go in-person, they may not necessarily be able to do so. As a result, some students may not end up utilizing their library resources which could otherwise boost their academic performance. To fix this issue, we will create a web-based application where students can easily see what items are available without having to physically go to the library.

## Dependencies
.NET 8.0

## Tech Stack
Blazor WebAssembly Application with a SQL database on the backend (subject to change)
